title: 'Learning Rust'
excerpt: 'Learning any new programming is hard. It can be easier if you start breaking down the new language into managable smaller projects. If you are not interested in learning Rust that is ok because this learning process can work with just about anything.'

## A Brief History

I read through the Rust Lang book that is provided here. I also went to the Rust Youtube channel here and watched several people discuss the internals of async/wait in Rust. I wish I could say it wasn't over my head. I went back to the Rust website and found several options for learning more, so I started with the example section here. 

## Why Rust?

Now that I'm thinking about it I don't remember exactly how I discovered Rust, but I remember stumbling upon (oh, how I miss this site) [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) by Philipp Oppermann. I like the challenge of learning new things, so creating my own operating system while learning this new language seemed like a good fit for me personally. The problem though, I'm not ready to deep diving into Phillipp's blog as I'm grossly inadquate in understanding system level languages like Rust. It will still be a while before I think I can full unleash Rust.

## First App
The first post has to be something greater than a "hello world" right? [Wrong, we must learn about the macros](hello-world)
