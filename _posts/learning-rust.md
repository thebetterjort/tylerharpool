title: 'Learning Rust'
excerpt: 'Learning any new programming is hard. It can be easier if you start breaking down the new language into managable smaller projects. If you are not interested in learning Rust that is ok because this learning process can work with just about anything.'

## A Brief History

Reading through the [Rust Lang book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) was a deceptively exciting and an engaging experience. The whole feeling of building out these super fast cargos of code was thrilling. Later, I found a [Rust Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaYhcUwRBNscFNUKTjgPFiA) and [one video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skos4B5x7qE) where several people were discussing the internals of [async/wait](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/04_async_await_primer.html). Unless you are a [Rust Developer team](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/graphs/contributors) you probably aren't going to find much value. Going back to the [Rust website](https://rust-lang.org) you will find several different options for learning. My favorite of course is learning by example. Let's go through those first.

## Why Rust?

 I don't remember how I discovered Rust, but I do remember stumbling upon [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) by Philipp Oppermann. I think it was this time that I decided that I need to take a look at Rust. Besides, I like the challenge of learning new things, so creating my own operating system and learning a new language seemed like a good fit.

## First App
The first post has to be something greater than a "hello world" right? [Wrong, we must learn about the macros](hello-world). We will learn Rust by building out several mini projects that will make our skills razor sharp.
